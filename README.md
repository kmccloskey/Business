Cookies for Coders
Cookies for Coders is a project designed to represent a local Philly food truck.
Our business provides delicious cookies for coders and non-coders alike throughout the city of Philadelphia.
Business is doing well but we feel that a website could greatly increase our exsposure.
Our fans will have the ability to place orders online as well as find our menu and information about us.
Consists of a Home page informing our guest, a contact page where they can order food, a menu page where they can find all of our products
as well as an about us page explaing our mission of getting coders cookies.
